## How do I choose a solution?

If your question has been answered, please mark the solution.
That way, someone in the future can easily see what worked for you.

If you’re the original poster (OP), there should be a little
box at the bottom of replies that you can click to select that response
as your “solution.”

## How do I change categories?

When changing the category for a question, you will not lose anything.
The thread stays the same. All you need to do is click the pencil icon
next to the post title, and then use the dropdown to select a different
category.

## Is it cool if I cross-post?

If you post your question in more than one place (AKA cross-posting),
you should always link to the other post. Not doing so is generally
considered to be rude - someone might spend their time answering the
question on StackOverflow, for example, when it’s already been answered
here. For this reason, cross-posting is generally discouraged.

If you must ask in multiple places, please make it very clear that you
have done so, and once you have an answer in one place, make sure to
update all of your questions accordingly.
